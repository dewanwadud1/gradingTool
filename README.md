### BDIC DSA Project 1 Grading Tool
A convenient grading assistant for Teachers/TAs, initially developed for grading the project 1 of DSA course at BDIC, this tool streamlines the evaluation process 
by tracking essential rubric criteria within student reports and code submissions. It automatically compiles feedback and calculates scores based on fulfilled criteria, 
offering an efficient way to provide consistent grading and feedback.

Ongoing enhancements aim to broaden its applicability across various courses.
